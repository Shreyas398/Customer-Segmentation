# Customer Segmentation using RFM, PCA & K-Means Clustering

This project performs data-driven customer segmentation using the **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** model and **K-Means clustering**, with optional **PCA** for dimensionality reduction. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on purchasing behavior, enabling targeted marketing, retention campaigns, and optimized business strategies.

## 📌 Why This Project Matters

Businesses often treat all customers the same — resulting in wasted marketing spend and poor retention.  
This project helps solve that by:

- Identifying **high-value customers**  
- Detecting **at-risk or dormant customers**  
- Improving **personalized marketing**  
- Enhancing **customer lifetime value (CLV)**  
- Prioritizing resources for maximum ROI  

This is one of the most practical and widely used segmentation techniques in analytics, product, and marketing teams.
